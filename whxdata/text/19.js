For instance, 10% of 100 is 10 Percent."," ","Π"," ","Pi"," ","Most famously known and used as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Pi has found its way into other mathematics as well such as physics."," ","e"," ","Euler's number"," ","e or sometimes called \"Euler's number\" is an irrational number that is the base of \"natural logarithm\" here it is to thirty places: 2.7182818284590452353602874713527"," ","φ"," ","Phi"," ","Phi is an irrational number equal to 1.6180.... and is known as the golden ratio."," ","τ"," ","Tau"," ","Tau constant 6.2831853071"," ","Inv"," ","Inverse"," ","INV(x) returns the multiplicative inverse of x, so that x * inv(x) = 1."," ","sin"," ","Sine"," ","A trigonometric function used to calculate the sine of angles either in gradians, radians, or degrees."," ","cos"," ","Cosine"," ","A trigonometric function used to calculate the cosine of an angle either in gradians, radians, or degrees."," ","log"," ","Log"," ","LOG is the base-10 logarithm"," ","deg"," ","Degree"," ","This button turns on angle mode so that when you enter a number it assumes it's in degrees."," ","√"," ","Square root"," ","Will find the square root of any number. For instance, the square root of 9 is 3 or the square root of 5 is 2.236068"," ","x2"," ","To the second power."," ","Performs the function on the number entered. Example: 5^2 = 25."," ","x3"," ","To the third power."," ","Performs the function on the number entered. Example: 5^3 = 125."," ","^"," ","Caret"," ","Exponent"," ","exp"," ","Natural exponential function"," ","Rnd"," ","Random number."," ","Will produce a random number between 0 and 1."," ","Ans"," ","Last Answer"," ","If you would like to use the calculator's memory you can use this button to get the last answer and use it in your next equation. Example. 5x5=25 then after you clear the calculator you can hit 4xAns=100 because it's 4 x 25."]],"id":"19"})
